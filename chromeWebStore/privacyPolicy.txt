This Privacy Policy describes how the Movie Time Chrome extension handles information and protects user privacy. Movie Time is designed to operate without collecting, storing, transmitting or processing personal data beyond what is strictly necessary to enable peer-to-peer video synchronization and optional video chat between two consenting users. By installing or using Movie Time, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.

Movie Time does not collect, store or transmit any personal information to external servers. The extension contains no analytics, tracking scripts, advertising components, telemetry systems or remote logging of any kind. The developer does not receive, access or retain any data generated by the user during operation of the extension.

All information required for the functioning of the extension is processed exclusively within the user’s browser. When establishing a peer-to-peer session, the extension generates WebRTC Offer and Answer objects that are necessary to enable the connection. These objects remain entirely local to the user’s device unless the user chooses to manually copy and share them with another party. Movie Time never uploads these objects or any other form of connection-related data.

If the user activates the video chat feature, the browser may request permission to access the user’s camera and microphone. Any resulting audio or video stream is transmitted solely through encrypted WebRTC channels directly to the selected peer. Movie Time does not record, store, route or relay media through any server, nor does it collect or access the content of those communications. Disabling the video chat or turning off the camera or microphone immediately terminates the corresponding transmission.

To synchronize Netflix playback between two users, Movie Time reads the current playback time, pause state and duration of the local HTML video element on the Netflix page. This information is used exclusively to keep the two players aligned and is not logged or stored. Playback information is transmitted only through the direct peer-to-peer data channel and only to the specific peer chosen by the user.

The extension requests minimal Chrome permissions that are strictly necessary to operate. These include storage for preserving the popup state locally on the user’s device, clipboard read access to allow the user to paste signaling information, tab access to communicate with the active Netflix tab, and host permissions limited to netflix.com to enable injection of the overlay and playback synchronization. The extension does not operate on, nor does it access, any other websites.

Movie Time does not knowingly collect information from children and does not target minors. As no personal data is collected in any form, no profiling, data sharing or data retention occurs.

Security is inherently reinforced by the architectural choice to avoid servers entirely. All communication between users is end-to-end encrypted and handled through the browser’s WebRTC implementation. The developer has no access to any communication or media exchanged between users.

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any modifications will apply prospectively from the date of publication. Users are encouraged to review this policy periodically.

For any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or the handling of data within Movie Time, please contact the developer at dev.movietime@gmail.com.
