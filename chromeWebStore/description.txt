⭐ Movie Time – Watch Netflix together, from anywhere  
Enjoy your favourite movies and shows as if you were sitting next to each other with real-time synchronized playback and built-in video chat.  
No accounts. No servers. No data collection. Just the two of you, sharing the moment.


⚠️ Important for a smooth experience  
1. For the best connection, use a home Wi-Fi network.  
   Mobile networks (4G/5G) and restrictive public/work Wi-Fi often block peer-to-peer traffic and may prevent the call from working correctly.

2. Also remember: if you refresh the Netflix page or navigate to a different Netflix URL within the same tab, Movie Time fully resets.  
   The call ends, the sync stops, and you'll need to recreate or rejoin the session from the beginning.  
   You can freely switch to other browser tabs, just keep one Netflix tab and don’t refresh it!


🎬 How to get started  
After installing the extension, simply open Netflix and click the Movie Time icon.  
A small popup will guide you to test your connection, create a session, or join an existing one.

Creating a session  
1. Click “Create Session” → “Generate Offer”  
2. Copy the generated text and send it to the person you want to watch with.

Joining a session  
1. Click “Join Session”  
2. Paste the text you received → “Generate Answer”  
3. Send your answer back to the other person.

Final step  
The person who created the session just needs to paste the answer they received and press “Connect”.

🎥 What happens next  
Once connected, a floating overlay appears on your Netflix tab so you can see and hear each other while watching together.  
You can drag it around the screen and resize it through the bottom-right corner.  
You can also toggle your camera, microphone, and playback sync at any time.

🔄 How synchronization works  
Before enabling sync, both of you should open the same movie or episode on Netflix.  
Then press the sync button: playback will instantly stay aligned for both of you.  
Press again at any time to disable synchronization.

❤️ Movie Time  
Whether you're in a long-distance relationship, watching with a friend across the world, or simply sharing a show with someone you care about — Movie Time makes it feel like you're together.
